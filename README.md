# real-time-sound-classification
## Install dlib `conda install -c conda-forge dlib`
## Install numpy `pip install numpy`
## Need to install dlib and numpy first then use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Now support two sound classification models `YAMNet` and `aclnet` (change the configuration file to use the model)
## Can decide if the output is in a log file or in console in file `common_util.py` (will add to config file later)
